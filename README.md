## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS preprocessor
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- GULP

### What I learned

During this challenge I consolidated my knowledge of Flexbox and making responsive layouts. I also learned how to make [tabs](./src/js/tabs.js) and [bullets](./src/js/bullets.js). Surely, I implemented them on the [destination](./src/destination.html), [crew](./src/crew.html) and [technology](./src/technology.html) pages.
