    <h1>03 Space launch</h1>
    <p>
      101 1 2 3 The terminology... Launch vehicle A launch vehicle or carrier
      rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a payload from Earth's
      surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier
      rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's
      quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!

      101 1 2 3 The terminology... Spaceport A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site
      for launching (or receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport for
      ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape Canaveral, our
      spaceport is ideally situated to take advantage of the Earthâ€™s rotation
      for launch.

      101 1 2 3 The terminology... Space capsule A space capsule is an
      often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry capsule to reenter
      the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend
      your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, and plenty
      of other activities to keep you entertained.
